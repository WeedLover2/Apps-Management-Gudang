# Warehouse Management System

This project was a simple MERN stack, CRUD application that my friends and I developed as part of our learning modules to help us complete our internship tasks at Educourse. My role in this project was as a backend developer, where I built the backend logic using Node.js and Express. My friend, Fategreedtony, served as the frontend developer and built the user interface with React. Special thanks to Mr. sindhu-nugroho for mentoring us throughout this project.
